# angular1-es6-with-decorators
An example of angular 1.x application written in ES 2015 with decorators that resemble angular 2

While Angular 2 is already available there are a lot of code and libraries that are still in Angular 1.x. 
Here we show a transition path from Angular 1.x to Angular 2.
This means you will be able to start writing in ES 2015, and use decorators, or continue to use and depend on old style code.
